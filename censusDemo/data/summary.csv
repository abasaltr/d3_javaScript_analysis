0,0,1,The demographics illustrates an upward trend among states with the percentages of higher poverty rate correlating directly to the lack of healthcare. A larger cluster of states are showing populations roughly within 12-18% in poverty to 8-18% lacking healthcare. This is a relatively high correlation.
0,0,2,"States with the highest poverty in the 20 percentiles are Mississippi, New Mexico, and Louisiana which are depicting about 15-18% lacking healthcare. In contrast, Massachusetts having the lowest poverty under 12% is also having the lowest percentage lacking healthcare of under 5%."
0,0,3,"Notably, Texas has the highest percentage of people lacking healthcare with over 24% and disappointedly having a high percentage in poverty as well."
0,1,1,The demographics illustrates an upward trend among states with the percentages of higher poverty rate correlating directly to smoking habits. A larger cluster of states are showing populations roughly within 12-18% in poverty to 14-22% that smokes. This is a relatively high correlation and a higher percentage compared to those that lack healthcare. A difference of about 4-6% increase.
0,1,2,"States with the highest poverty in the 20 percentiles are Mississippi, New Mexico, and Louisiana which are depicting about 19-24% smokes. In contrast, Utah having a lower poverty under 12% is also having the lowest percentage that smokes of under 10%. Interestingly, New Hampshire having the lowest poverty of 9.2% shows 17.5% that smokes."
0,1,3,"Lastly, Texas having the highest percentage of people lacking healthcare with over 24% as shown in other illustrations depict a correlation of a closer percentage in poverty to smoking (17.2% versus 14.5%). However, when compared to other states, smoking is moderate and roughly equivalent to New York (14.4%) and California (12.9%)."
0,2,1,"The demographics illustrates an upward trend among states with the percentages of higher poverty rate correlating directly to obesity. A larger cluster of states are showing populations roughly within 12-18% in poverty to 24-33% who are obese. This is a relatively high correlation and a higher percentage compared to those that smokes or lacks healthcare. A difference of about 10% and 16% increase, respectively."
0,2,2,"States with the highest poverty in the 20 percentiles are Mississippi, New Mexico, and Louisiana which are depicting about 28-36% obesity. In contrast, Colorado having a lower poverty at 12% is also having the lowest percentage of obesity at 21.3%. Interestingly and similarly to smoking habits, New Hampshire having the lowest poverty of 9.2% shows higher obesity at 27.4%."
0,2,3,"Finally, Texas having the highest percentage of people lacking healthcare with over 24% as shown in other illustrations depict a correlation of a higher percentage in poverty to obesity (17.2% versus 31.9%). However, when compared to other states, obesity is not so moderate and only falls behind 10 other states such as Oklahoma (33.0%) and South Carolina (32.1%)."
1,0,1,"The demographics does not illustrate any trend among other states; however, there is a notable correlation of the population in most states within the upper 30s median age group that lacks the highest percentages of healthcare ranging anywhere between 8-18%. This is a relatively isolated correlation that focuses on a specific age group."
1,0,2,"States with the highest median age at over 40 are West Virginia, Florida, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine showing various percentages that lacks healthcare. For example, in Florida, 17.6% lacks healthcare, but in Vermont, 6.7%. In contrast, Utah having the lowest median age at 31 falls in the middle of percentages that lacks healthcare at about 14%."
1,0,3,"Notably, Texas having the highest percentage of people lacking healthcare with about 25% shows a median age of 34 which is a little shy of a couple of years compared to most other states. Also, worth noting is Massachusetts having the lowest at 4.6% shows a median age of 39."
1,1,1,"The demographics does not illustrate any trend among other states; however, there is a notable correlation of the population in most states within the upper 30s median age group having the highest percentages of smokers between 14-24%. This is a relatively isolated correlation that focuses on a specific age group but is higher compared to those that lacks healthcare. A difference of about 6% increase which is also in parallel to the poverty change."
1,1,2,"States with the highest median age at over 40 are West Virginia, Florida, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine showing various percentages that smokes. For example, in Florida, 17.7% smokes (like the amount that lacks healthcare), but in Vermont, 16.4% (much higher amount). In contrast, Utah having the lowest median age at 31 is also having the lowest percent of smokers at just under 10%. In fact, this is even lower than the 14% that lacks healthcare shown in the other illustrations."
1,1,3,"Lastly, Texas having the highest percentage of people lacking healthcare with about 25% shows a median age of 34 and 14.5% that smokes. Surprisingly, this is great for Texas which is ranked in the top 5 falling just short of New York (14.4%), Hawaii (14.1%), and California (12.9%). Also, worth noting is West Virginia showing a median age of 42 is having the highest smokers at 26.7%."
1,2,1,"The demographics illustrates somewhat of an upward trend among states with the percentages of higher median age correlating directly to obesity. Somewhat because the trend shifts back down as fewer states having higher obesity over the 40s. A larger cluster of states are showing populations roughly within the upper 30s median age range to 26-36% who are obese. This is a relatively high correlation and a higher percentage compared to those that smokes or lacks healthcare. A difference of about 12% and 18% increase, respectively."
1,2,2,"States with the highest obesity across various median ages are West Virginia, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana having close to 35% obesity. In contrast, Colorado having the lowest obesity at 21% is also having similar median age of 36."
1,2,3,"Finally, Texas having the highest percentage of people lacking healthcare with over 24% as shown in other illustrations depict the same correlation to age with about 32% obesity close to that of Mississippi, Louisiana, and Oklahoma figures. These states are geographically in closer proximity to one another."
2,0,1,The demographics illustrates a downward trend among states with higher median income correlating directly to the lack of healthcare. A larger cluster of states are showing populations roughly with an income range of $40K-$55K to about 7-19% lacking healthcare. This is a relatively moderate correlation.
2,0,2,"States with the lowest income closer to $40K are Mississippi, West Virginia, and Arkansas lacks healthcare within the same percentile range noted above. Similarly, in Maryland having the highest income of over $73K is also having a low percentage that lacks healthcare at under 10%."
2,0,3,"Notably, Texas has the highest percentage of people lacking healthcare with about 25% and a median income of about $53K. Although at the high end, this too falls within the income range of most other states. In contrast, in Massachusetts having one of the highest median income close to $70K, its population has the lowest lack in healthcare at 4.6%. This is considerably lower than the 7% noted above which is good news for the state."
2,1,1,"Like the populations that lacks healthcare, the demographics illustrates a downward trend among states with higher median income correlating directly to the percent of smokers. However, a larger cluster of states are showing populations roughly with an income range of $40K-$55K to about 15-27% smokers. This is a relatively high correlation and a higher percentage compared to those that lack healthcare. A difference of an 8% increase."
2,1,2,"States with the lowest income closer to $40K are Mississippi, West Virginia, and Arkansas also have the highest smokers above 23%. In contrast, in Maryland having the highest income of over $73K is also having a low percentage that smokes below 15%."
2,1,3,"Lastly, Texas having the highest percentage of people that lacks healthcare with about 25% and a median income of about $53K also has smokers below 15%. It is worth noting that in Utah having an income of over $60K, it has the lowest smokers at 9.7%. This is considerably lower than the 15% noted above which is great news for the state of Utah."
2,2,1,"Like the populations that lacks healthcare or smokes, the demographics illustrates a downward trend among states with higher median income correlating directly to the percent of obesity. However, a larger cluster of states are showing populations roughly with an income range of $40K-$55K to about 26-36% obesity. This is a relatively high correlation and a higher percentage compared to those that smokes or lacks healthcare. A difference of about 9% and 19% increase, respectively."
2,2,2,"States with the lowest income closer to $40K are Mississippi, West Virginia, and Arkansas also have the highest obesity above 35%. Similarly, in Maryland having the highest income close to $74K shows obesity at about 30% which is well within the amount noted above."
2,2,3,"Finally, Texas having the highest percentage of people that lacks healthcare with about 25% and a median income of about $53K also has higher obesity at close to 32%. This is not good for the health of the state. At the same token, in Colorado with about an $8K more income than Texas, it has a much lower obesity at 21.3%. A huge difference of over 10% which is an excellent insight onto the populations overall health."
